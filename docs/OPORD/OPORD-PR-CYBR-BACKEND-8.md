# OPORD-PR-CYBR-BACKEND-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENTâ€™s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be achieved through executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
Effective backend systems are crucial for supporting the application infrastructure of PR-CYBR. Adjustments are needed to improve user experience by facilitating dynamic interactions with the server-side processes.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure that the script incorporates `scripts/setup.sh`, deploying TMUX to create four interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission will primarily focus on enhancing backend capabilities for efficient user engagement through the new terminal setup.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to initiate the setup process efficiently.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to automate necessary cloning and TMUX window setups.
   - Update `setup.py` for any new dependencies required.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to validate the new backend functionalities.
   - Revise `README.md` to reflect updates and user guidance.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Establish four terminal windows with the following functions:
     - **Window 1**: Show a welcome message, options, and a loading bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` to monitor system processes.
     - **Window 3**: Use `tail -f` to display logs created by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Show output from `ls -l` in the repository root.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Ensure updates are tracked and documented through version control.
- Conduct a review of new functionalities post-implementation with stakeholders.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Provide updates and interact through established communication channels.
- Ensure seamless integration across all agents involved in the workflow.

**This OPORD directs the PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT to fulfill its tasks in alignment with overall project objectives.**
