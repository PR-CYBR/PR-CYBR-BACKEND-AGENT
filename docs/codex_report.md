# Codex Operational Report

This document aggregates operational insights produced by the automation workflows.

## Latest Scan Summary
- **Workflow health:** All four Codex workflows are configured with required triggers (PR scans, commit discussions, wiki updates, setup maintenance).
- **Documentation alignment:** `codex_review.md` and `codex_report.md` form the reviewer source of truth for Codex governance.
- **Dashboard status:** The `dashboard/` application surfaces workflow telemetry as described in the integration notes.

## Follow-Up Actions
| Area | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow Automation | Reliability Agent | Review maintenance logs from the latest `codex-setup-maintenance` run. |
| Dashboard UX | Interface Agent | Validate that live data bindings match `dashboard_config.json` schema. |
| Knowledge Base | Documentation Agent | Ensure wiki change summaries are captured in the report archive. |

## Archive Instructions
1. Export action artifacts for each successful workflow execution.
2. Update the sync matrix when dependencies shift.
3. Record any manual overrides or exceptions handled outside automation.
